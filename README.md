## Original Site Analysis
*Site:* [Toronto](http://jaddy.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/dms290/assignment02/home.html)

### Mood
Toronto (as portrayed in the site) is a modern city, "known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings". It is the capital of its province, and is growing in population. It is also known for its multiculturalism and diversity.

However, the colors and layout do not reflect the modern nature of Toronto. The colors are teal and seafoam, with dark blue thrown in unfittingly. The readability can definitely be improved, yet legibility is alright.

### Fonts
The typeface used for the entire site is Arial, a solid and reliable neo-grotesque that sits in the middle between being distinguished and being invisible. It has minimal personality, great legibility, and is overall the picture of a "safe bet" typeface. The body text is set in a weight 400 16px font, while the title is in 300 32px. Neither weight is extreme enough to be stylistically interesting, to the benefit of the body text and to the detriment of the header text. Legibility doesn't need to be improved upon, yet personality definitely should be.

## Font Choices
For headlines I decided upon Kiwi Maru, a cutesy geometric slab serif that has a fairly low descender line and a moderately high x-height. There are bulbs on the terminals that give it a childish and friendly appearance, while the geometric style of the overall letterforms lends it legitimacy and a tinge of formality. This choice reflects the fact that many consider Toronto to be a fun and lively city, while also honoring the fact that it retains official roles as the capital of the province.

For the copy text I selected Inter, a heavily versatile grotesque sans that lends itself to legibility. Body text should mainly feature invisible fonts, as the more you notice the letterforms the less you notice the words. Inter fades into the background easily, while projecting a professional and modern air.

## Changes
I changed the line height of the body text (for better readability), the font styling of headers (for better legibility, no faux-italics), the overall base font weight (for better readability) since it was unspecified, and I shrank the width of the main section to reduce the line lengths (for better readability). Additionally I changed the text colors used in the headers for legibility, since it was too low contrast.
