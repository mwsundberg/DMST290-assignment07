## Original Site Analysis
*Site:* [Toronto](http://jaddy.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/dms290/assignment02/home.html)

###Mood
Toronto (as portrayed in the site) is a modern city, "known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings". It is the capital of its province, and is growing in population. It is also known for its multiculturalism and diversity.

However, the colors and layout do not reflect the modern nature of Toronto. The colors are teal and seafoam, with dark blue thrown in unfittingly. The readability can definitely be improved, yet legibility is alright.

### Fonts
The typeface used for the entire site is Arial, a solid and reliable typeface that sits in the middle between being distinguished and being invisible. It has minimal personality, great legibility, and is overall the picture of a "safe bet" typeface. The body text is set in a weight 400 16px font, while the title is in 300 32px. Neither weight is extreme enough to be stylistically interesting, to the benefit of the body text and to the detriment of the header text. Legibility doesn't need to be improved upon, yet personality definitely should be.
